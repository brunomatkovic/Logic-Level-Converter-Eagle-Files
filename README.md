## Description and details
If you've ever tried to use 3.3V device inside 5V system, you know how complicated it can be. This Bi-directional logic level converter steps down 5V signals to 3.3V and steps up 3.3V signals to 5V at the same time. It can also work with 2.8V and 1.8V devices. This device has a capability of converting 4 pins of the high side to 4 pins of the low side with 2 inputs and 2 outputs provided for both sides.

Using this converter ain't a problem. Board needs to be powered from 2 voltage sources (high and low voltage) that your system is using. For example, 5V to HV, 3.3V to LV and system's ground to GND pin.
