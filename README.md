## Description and details
Croduino Pico is a sequel to Croduino Basic board. It is more simple than the Basic version since it doesn't have FTDI converter onboard so it needs another board which has one for programming(Croduino Basic, for example). It is imagined to be used for leaving in projects and products. 

* Atmega328 microcontroller(32kB flash, 2kB RAM, 0.5kB EEPROM)
* 22 I/O pins, 14 digital I/O, 6 PWM, 8 analog pins
* Size only 3 x 5cm
* LED light on the 13th pin
* Voltage regulator for a possibility of external charging
* Made in Croatia (EU)

Should be set up as "Arduino Nano w/ Atmega328" in Arduino software. A project is OSH and files are available to download.
